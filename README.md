# firmwalker
A simple script for searching the extracted firmware file system for goodies!

The script is meant to be run inside the "rootfs" directory after the file system is extracted from the firmware.

It will search through the extracted or mounted file system for things of interest such as:

* etc/shadow and etc/passwd
*
